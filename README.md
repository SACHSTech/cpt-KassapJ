# ICS4U CPT - Spotify Data Visualizer

## The data that was chosen to be used in this assignment, was user data that anyone can access from their account, by requesting it from spotify. 
### I decided that I wanted to work with this data, because I believe data visualization can be extremely fun if it's something the person can relate to. Most people have a spotify account, and I love music. Therefore this was a perfect choice for me and the friends I want to show it to.

## Here's a Tutorial to add your data to this program

### First go to your account overview at https://www.spotify.com/us/account/overview/

### Second go to the Privacy Settings of your account

### You'll want to scroll down, and request the data on the left

### In about 5 days, spotify will send you a folder with your data in it

### Unzip and open the MyData folder they give you

### Drag and drop all "StreamingHistory(number)" files to the "SpotifyJsonFilesHERE" folder in this project

### Run the main code, and you're all set. 

## Changing the data

### To change the data, delete all jsons in the "SpotifyJsonFilesHERE" folder, and delte the "data.csv" in the "ConvertedFiles" folder
### Running the main again will process the files again
